Welcome to PlusTalk!

Project Introduction:

This project was originally started at a hackathon in March 2023, alongside collaborator Ricky Titanti (UI Designer for the PlusTalk App) but due to my then inexperience with react, and getting busy with University, I was unable to continue developing it until June 2023.

This project is my first website ever built (played around in some HTML/CSS previously but never took web development serious until now). To experienced developers some of the code may seem sloppy or unoptimized but I am using this project to grow and learn.

About:

PlusTalk aims to teach users different languages by teaching users various phrases based on specific categories (lessons), such as "Greetings & Introductions", "Asking & Answering Questions", etc...

Languages currently available -
4 lessons each with 4 sublessons with 4 phrases each: Spanish, Portuguese, & Italian (As a spanish speaker it was quite straightforward to cross-reference each of these and ensure they are appropriate translations)

4 lessons with only 1 sublesson with 4 phrases each: Hindi (I've yet to find a Hindi speaker to cross reference them)


Resources used to build: Videos from The Net Ninja's Material UI tutorial on youtube is what I initially used to start the project, to set up basic react router and using card components. Eventually moved on to the React Documentation & Stack Overflow to solve any errors as they came up. React Documentation was used for the Accordion style functionality displayed on each language page to toggle each lesson, and also to toggle each card.

Commands for running: "Npm Run Dev" - like any NextJS Project

***Create A Note feature is currently being worked on, have not copied it from the old PlusTalk repository (Private on my GitHub)


Folder Description:

Components are in /components folder with three options, /images, /learning and /select

/learning : Most Populated folder: has all the components related to words from each of the languages, as well as the components that are spread among the languages (NavBar)

/select: Only has components related to the initial select page function

/images: Only has the Plus Talk Logo

Contact Info: I look forward to connecting with more developers of all experience levels & I am eager for any advice regarding how to improve as a developer, LinkedIn is "https://www.linkedin.com/in/leonardolujan/" or on GitHub profile page.
